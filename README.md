Steps to Run the Pipeline:
--------------------------
1. Place raw reads in 'raw_reads/' folder, named as '<sample>_R1_001.fastq.gz' and '<sample>_R2_001.fastq.gz'.
2. Update 'config/config.yaml' with your sample names, database paths, and thread settings.
3. Activate the pipeline environment:
   conda activate virpipe_short1
4. Run the pipeline with:
   snakemake --cores <number_of_cores> --use-conda
